# multi_linear_regression_from_scratch
In this repository. There is a code showing how multiple linear regression works from scratch.

For naming convention some name of some methods like model.fit(), model.predict(), model.score() are given as per my own point of view.

This code is innitially genetrated from ChatGPT with a prompt "pyhton code for internal working of Grdient decent".

for the ease of my own understanding this code is simplified by changing some lines of code.
